This is the code for Major Project 1 

main.py is currently the hand tracking software in its purest form - the first verions of hand tracking - i think ill number them soon

(1) First version of hand tracking that works that doesn't use mediapipe solutions. 
It uses the webcam to mark the landmarks using mediapipe and then manually adds the lines connecting the landmarks.
